## <a id='push-app'></a> Pushing an Application

One of the primary activities for developer users of
<%= vars.app_runtime_short %> is to push an application to the platform.

in the _<%= vars.standard_runtime_name %> Administrator Guide_.


## <a id='provision-bind-services'></a> Provision and Bind Service Instances

Many apps running on <%= vars.app_runtime_short %> depend on external services such as databases or message queues.
<%= vars.app_runtime_short %> allows developers to provision such services through its services marketplaces and to bind them to apps automatically.
For more information about provisioning and binding services, see

<%= vars.app_runtime_short %> supports updating applications to a new version by gradual replacement of application instances,
often called a rolling deployment. For more information about performing a rolling app deployment, see
