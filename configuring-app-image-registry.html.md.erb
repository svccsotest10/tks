This topic describes how to configure <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_short %>)
to access container image registries,
and how to create and configure a new private registry
for <%= vars.app_runtime_short %>.

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

<%= vars.app_runtime_short %> pulls system component container images
from the [VMware Tanzu Network container registry](https://registry.pivotal.io/),
and retains those images in a private container image registry.

Before you begin this procedure, ensure that you have
created a private container image registry. VMware recommends that you use a VMware Harbor registry
as your container image registry.

To use a VMware Harbor registry as your container image registry,
complete the procedures in [Use Harbor as Your Application Image Registry](#configure-harbor-registry) below.

To use a different registry as your container image registry,
complete the procedures in [Use a Different Image Registry](#configure-other-registry) below.


## <a id='configure-harbor-registry'></a> Use Harbor as Your Application Image Registry

To use a VMware Harbor registry as your container image registry:

* [Create a Harbor Project and User Account](#harbor-project-user)
* [Configure the Harbor Project](#harbor-project-configure)
* [Retrieve the Harbor CA Certificate](#harbor-ca-cert)
* [Configure the App Image Registry](#harbor-config-file)

### <a id='harbor-project-user'></a> Create a Harbor Project and User Account

Harbor requires that your create a Harbor project before pushing container images
to Harbor.

To create a Harbor project for your <%= vars.app_runtime_short %> container images:

1. Open your browser and navigate to your Harbor registry.

    ```
    https://HARBOR-FQDN/
    ```
    Where `HARBOR-FQDN` is  the fully qualified domain name for your Harbor installation.

1. Log in with your Harbor administrative credentials.

1. Create a new Harbor user named `tas-app-images-push-pull`.
You must provide a username and password to create the account.
For more information, see [Create a new user]
(https://goharbor.io/docs/1.10/administration/managing-users/create-users-db/)
in the Harbor documentation.

1. Create a new Harbor project named `tas-app-images`.
For more information, see [Create a new private project]
(https://goharbor.io/docs/1.10/working-with-projects/create-projects/)
in the Harbor documentation.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>
  If you specify custom project and user names in the
  Harbor configuration procedure above, use the same project and user names when configuring the
  <code>values.yml</code> file. For more information, see <a href="#harbor-config-file">
    Configure the App Image Registry</a> below.
</p>

### <a id='harbor-project-configure'></a> Configure the Harbor Project

To grant your Harbor user account permissions to your Harbor project:

1. Open your Harbor registry in a browser, and open the **Projects** list.

1. Click the `tas-app-images` project in the Projects list,
and select the **Members** tab.

1. Click the **+ USER** button to open the **New Member** dialog box.

1. In the **Name** field, enter `tas-app-images-push-pull`.

1. In the **Role** field, select the **Master** option.

1. Click **OK** to add the user to your Harbor project.

For more information on the Harbor `Master` role, see
[Managing Users](https://goharbor.io/docs/1.10/administration/managing-users/)
in the Harbor documentation.


### <a id='harbor-ca-cert'></a> Retrieve the Harbor CA Certificate

<%= vars.app_runtime_short %> must use your
Harbor registry's CA certificate or self-signed certificate
to access the registry.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>
If you did not use the Ops Manager tile to deploy your Harbor installation,
contact your Harbor installation administrator to obtain the CA certificate
that issued the Harbor certificate.
</p>

To retrieve the CA certificate or self-signed certificate from an
Ops Manager-deployed Harbor tile:

1. Log in to Ops Manager as an administrative user and navigate to the **Installation Dashboard**.

1. Click the **VMware Harbor Registry** tile.

1. Navigate to the **Certificate** configuration pane and
scroll down to the **Certificate Authority (CA)** field.

1. Copy the CA certificate:
    * If the **Certificate Authority (CA)** field contains a PEM-encoded certificate value,
    copy this value.
    * If the **Certificate Authority (CA)** field is blank, the certificate for the Harbor installation was
    likely issued from the Ops Manager root CA certificate.
<br>
        To download the Ops Manager root CA certificate:
        1. In the upper upper-right corner of the Ops Manager user interface, click the drop-down with your user name.
        1. Click **Settings**.
        1. In the **Settings** page, click **Advanced Options**.
        1. In the **Advanced Options** pane, click the **DOWNLOAD ROOT CA CERT** button.

1. Use the retrieved CA certificate as the certificate authority value when
    configuring <%= vars.app_runtime_short %>. For more information, see
    [Create the Harbor Image Registry Configuration File](#harbor-config-file) below.



### <a id='harbor-config-file'></a> Configure the App Image Registry

To configure <%= vars.app_runtime_short %> to use your private container image registry:

1. Change directory into the `configuration-values` directory you created earlier, and open the `values.yml` file in the `configuration-values` directory.

1. Populate the `app_registry` section of the file with the following:

    ```yaml
    app_registry:
      ca: |
        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        CA-CERTIFICATE-CONTENT
        -----END CERTIFICATE-----
      hostname: "HARBOR-FQDN"
      repository_prefix: "HARBOR-FQDN/tas-app-images"
      username: "tas-app-images-push-pull"
      password: "APP-REGISTRY-PASSWORD"
    ```

    Where:
    * `HARBOR-FQDN` is  the fully qualified domain name for your Harbor installation.
    * `APP-REGISTRY-PASSWORD` is the password you submitted for the `tas-app-images-push-pull` user.
    * `CA-CERTIFICATE-CONTENT` is the CA certificate or self-signed certificate for your Harbor
    registry. Ensure each line of the CA certificate value is indented four spaces,
    matching the indentation of the `BEGIN CERTIFICATE` and `END CERTIFICATE` lines above.
1. Save the file.

## <a id='configure-other-registry'></a> Use a Different Image Registry

In addition to supporting a VMware Harbor registry as a container image registry,
<%= vars.app_runtime_short %> also supports using other container image registries.  

To use Google Container Registry (GCR), Docker Hub, or another registry as your <%= vars.app_runtime_short %> container image registry:

1. Change directory into the `configuration-values` directory you created earlier.
1. Open the `values.yml` file.
1. Populate the `app_registry` section with the following:

    ```yaml
    app_registry:
      ca: ""
      hostname: "HOST-FQDN"
      repository_prefix: "REPOSITORY"
      username: "APP-REGISTRY-USERNAME"
      password: "APP-REGISTRY-PASSWORD"
    ```

    Where:
    * `HOST-FQDN` is the fully qualified domain name for your registry.
    * `REPOSITORY` is the full URL for the <%= vars.app_runtime_short %>
    project within your registry.
    * `APP-REGISTRY-USERNAME` is the username for an account with access to the
    <%= vars.app_runtime_short %> project within your registry.
    * `APP-REGISTRY-PASSWORD` is the password for the specified account.

1. (Optional) To specify a CA certificate for the registry, replace the empty `ca:` property with the following:

    ```
      ca: |
        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        CA-CERTIFICATE-CONTENT
        -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    ```
    Where `CA-CERTIFICATE-CONTENT` is the CA certificate or self-signed certificate for your
    registry. Ensure each line of the CA certificate value is indented four spaces,
    matching the indentation of the `BEGIN CERTIFICATE` and `END CERTIFICATE` lines above.
<br>
    Specifying a CA certificate is required if your registry does not have a
    certificate signed by a trusted authority.

1. Save the file.
