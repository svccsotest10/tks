This topic outlines the process for administering <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_short %>).

##<a id='administer'></a>Administer <%= vars.app_runtime_short %>

To administer <%= vars.app_runtime_short %> after initial installation:

1. **Create TAS Orgs and Spaces**: Developers create and manage their apps and service instances within spaces.
Every app, service, and route that developers create is scoped to a space.
Each space belongs to an org in the <%= vars.app_runtime_short %> installation.  
<br>
    To create orgs and spaces, follow the instructions
in [Orgs, Spaces, Roles, and Permissions]
(https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/concepts/roles.html) 
in the _<%= vars.standard_runtime_name %> Administrator Guide_.  

1. **Create TAS Quota Plans**: Quota plans are named sets of memory, service, and instance usage quotas that constrain
the usage of organizations within a <%= vars.app_runtime_short %> installation.  
<br>
    To create quota plans, follow the instructions
in [Creating and Modifying Quota Plans]
(https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/adminguide/quota-plans.html) 
in the _<%= vars.standard_runtime_name %> Administrator Guide_.
    

1. **Manage Service Brokers**: Developers typically need to connect their apps running on <%= vars.app_runtime_short %> to dependencies such as data services.
Service brokers give developers a self-service mechanism to provision these dependencies
and to connect them to their apps.  
<br>
    To make services available to app developers, 
register the service brokers and make the service plans public. 
For more information, see
[Managing Service Brokers](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/services/managing-service-brokers.html)
in the _<%= vars.standard_runtime_name %> Administrator Guide_.
