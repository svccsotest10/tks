<% current_page.data.title = "Installing #{vars.app_runtime_full}" %>

This topic describes how to prepare dependencies and your local workstation to install <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_short %>).

## <a id='preparing-installation-resources'></a> Prepare Your Installation Resources

Download the <%= vars.app_runtime_short %> installation resources from [VMware Tanzu Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/tas-for-kubernetes).

1. Log in to [VMware Tanzu Network](https://network.pivotal.io).

1. Navigate to [VMware <%= vars.app_runtime_full %>](https://network.pivotal.io/products/tas-for-kubernetes) on the _VMware Tanzu Network_.

1. Download the "Tanzu Application Service" file to a local directory of your choice and rename it to `tanzu-application-service.tar`.

1. Extract the contents of `tanzu-application-service.tar` into the `tanzu-application-service` directory:

    ```bash
    tar xvf tanzu-application-service.tar
    ```


## <a id='app-container-registry'></a> Ensure Your Container Registry is Accessible

<%= vars.app_runtime_short %> depends on a container image registry to
store images for buildpack-based applications.
Supported registries include Harbor, Google Container Registry (GCR), and Docker Hub.

If you are using Harbor as your container registry, ensure that it is deployed in your
environment and is accessible at a domain name of your choice.
The [VMware Harbor Registry tile](https://network.pivotal.io/products/harbor-container-registry)
is one option to deploy it when using Ops Manager.

Configure <%= vars.app_runtime_short %> to use your container registry when completing the procedures in
[Configuring Your App Image Registry](configuring-app-image-registry.html)
and [Configuring Your System Image Registry](configuring-sys-image-registry.html).


## <a id='system-domain'></a> Select a System Domain Name

Decide on the DNS domain name you intend to use for the <%= vars.app_runtime_short %>
system domain, for example `sys.tas.example.com`.
Neither this domain nor any of its subdomains should be in use for other services.

This domain name should be one for which you can create DNS records in a DNS zone.
You will create these DNS records later in the installation procedure.

This documentation uses `SYSTEM-DOMAIN` to refer to the value of this
system domain.

## <a id="next"></a> Next Steps

After you complete this procedure, proceed to 
[Installing Command-Line Tools](installing-command-line-tools.html).
